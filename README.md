  üëã Hi there,

  Welcome on my profile,

  I'm passionated by programmation, and I like a lot to do some little projects to learn always more.
  I mainly use **__python__** üêç for my projects but I also use sometimes **__html__**, **__css__** or **__arduino__**.
  I'm very interrested by Computer vision and Machin learning.

  I will share here some of my personnal projects. You can ask me any question about them by openning a pull request. Any feedback would be very appreciated to help me to improve myself

  I also participate to Eos project. Have a look on our website : [https://www.eos-projets.fr/](https://www.eos-projets.fr/) and our [Github organization](https://github.com/eos-projets)
